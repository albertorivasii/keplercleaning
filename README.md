# NASA Kepler Objects of Interest Data Cleaning
## Skills Used: Python (pandas, numpy), Tableau
### Data From NASA's [Kepler Objects of Interest Database](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative)
Personal Project cleaning and looking for interesting observations in NASA's Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) dataset.  Began with EDA and used NASA's documentation to define columns of interest.  Cleaned data by dropping NaN values and grouping by kepler_name.  Exported data to Tableau for data visualization.  Dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alberto.rivas.ii)

## Posibilities for Further Research
- Fill NaN values for columns instead of dropping all NaN values
- Aggregate data by a different column and look for other descriptive statistics
- Create a model to predict the KOI name based on the
